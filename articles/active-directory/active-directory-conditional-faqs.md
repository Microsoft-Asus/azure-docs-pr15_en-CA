## <a name="which-applications-work-with-conditional-access-policies"></a>Which applications work with conditional access policies?

**A:** Please see the topic, [Conditional access- What applications are supported](active-directory-conditional-access-supported-apps.md).

## <a name="are-conditional-access-policies-enforced-for-b2b-collaboration-and-guest-users"></a>Are conditional access policies enforced for B2B collaboration and guest users?

**A:** Policies are enforced for B2B collaboration users. However, in some cases, a user might not be able to satisfy the policy requirement if, for example, an organization does not support multi-factor authentication. 

The policy is currently not enforced for SharePoint guest users. The guest relationship is maintained within SharePoint. Guest users accounts are not subject to access polices at the authentication server. Guest access can be managed at SharePoint.

## <a name="does-a-sharepoint-online-policy-also-apply-to-onedrive-for-business"></a>Does a SharePoint Online policy also apply to OneDrive for Business?

**A:** Yes.
 
## <a name="why-cant-i-set-a-policy-on-client-apps-like-word-or-outlook"></a>Why canâ€™t I set a policy on client apps, like Word or Outlook?

**A:** A conditional access policy sets requirements for accessing a service and is enforced when authentication happens to that service. The policy is not set directly on a client application; instead, it is applied when it calls into a service. For example, a policy set on SharePoint applies to clients calling SharePoint and a policy set on Exchange applies to Outlook.


## <a name="does-a-conditional-access-policy-apply-to-service-accounts"></a>Does a conditional access policy apply to service accounts?

**A:** Conditional access policies apply to all user accounts. This includes user accounts used as service accounts. In many cases, a service account that runs unattended is not able to satisfy a policy. This is, for example the case, when MFA is required. In these cases, services accounts can be excluded from a policy, using conditional access policy management settings. Learn more about applying a policy to users here.
